title: Deploy your blind app to the Nillion Testnet
---

Your blind app is currently running locally against the nillion-devnet. Let's configure environment variables to point at the Nillion Testnet. That way anyone can play with your blind app once it's deployed.

## Update your .env file and test locally

Update your `.env` values to point at the Nillion Testnet

The `REACT_APP_NILLION_NILCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY` private key value above should correspond to an address you've funded with Testnet NIL.

### Create a Nillion Wallet and get the private Key

Follow the [Creating a Nillion Wallet guide](/guide-testnet-connect) to create your Nillion wallet. Note that when you create your wallet, you need to use the "Sign up with Google" option rather than "Use recovery phrase" option because Keplr only exposes the private key of wallets created when you "Sign up with Google."

Here's how to get the `REACT_APP_NILLION_NILCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY` value from a Nillion wallet created with a Google account:

### Fund the Nillion Wallet address that corresponds to your private key

Follow [the Nillion Faucet Guide](/guide-testnet-faucet) to learn how to get Testnet NIL to fund the Nillion wallet address that corresponds to your private key. This way your app can pay for operations.

Test the configuration locally against your blind app to make sure the full blind computation flow is working as expected.

## Set Headers and set up proxy for nilchain

## Commit your project to Github

Commit your repo to Github and tag your Github repo with `nillion-nada` so the rest of the Nillion community can find it.

## Host your blind app with Vercel

1. Follow the https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/import guide to import your Github project to Vercel

2. Follow the https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables guide to add all Testnet environment variables

3. Set up the vercel.json file with headers and proxy rewrites

```json reference showGithubLink
https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion/blob/main/vercel.json
```

4. Share your live link on [Nillion's Github Discussions Show and Tell Forum](https://github.com/orgs/NillionNetwork/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)

## Keep Exploring

ðŸ¥³ Congratulations on completing the Nillion Developer Quickstart and deploying your blind app to the Nillion testnet. Keep exploring and building by

- reading about [Nillion concepts](/concepts) and the [Nada Language](nada-lang)
- learning how to interact with and manage programs, secrets, and permissions on the Nillion Network with [Nillion Client](/js-client)
- challenging yourself to create a page that solves the [Millionaires Problem](/multi-party-computation#classic-scenario-the-millionaires-problem)
