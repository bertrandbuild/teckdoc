## What is a blind app?

A blind app runs blind computation on Nillion using one or more privacy-preserving [Nada](#nada-lang) programs. Nada programs compute on secret integers without ever seeing the underlying input values, making them ideal for sensitive data operations.

## Start building blind apps on Nillion

<Note title="info" tyle="note">
 This Blind App Quickstart is ideal for developers interested in creating frontends or fullstack web apps on Nillion. If you want to connect a backend to Nillion, [check out the Python Quickstart](#python-quickstart)
</Note>

Build your first blind application on Nillion. Follow the steps in this blind app quickstart to

1. [Install the Nillion SDK](#quickstart-install)
2. [Create a Nada project](#quickstart-nada) and write your first Nada program
3. [Build a blind app](#quickstart-blind-app) with the [cra-nillion](https://github.com/NillionNetwork/cra-nillion) starter repo (based on Create React App) and run your app locally on the [nillion-devnet](#nillion-devnet)
4. [Deploy your blind app to the Nillion Testnet](#quickstart-testnet) so the world can try it
