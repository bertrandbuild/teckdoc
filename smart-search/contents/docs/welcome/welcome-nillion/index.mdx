title: Welcome to Nillion's Docs
description: Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high value data in the same way that blockchains decentralized transactions.

**What if privacy was an enabler of use cases rather than a constraint?**

Developers can use Nillion to build secure, [high value data](high-value-data.md) focused blind applications. Nillion empowers developers to

- write programs in Nada, our language for defining blind computation programs
- compile programs with the Nada compiler
- upload programs to the Nillion Network
- store permissioned secrets (high value data) on the Nillion Network
- run programs to perform blind computation on secrets on the Nillion Network
