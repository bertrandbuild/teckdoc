# Clash of Nodes FAQs

### When will I receive my invitation to the incentivized testnet?

We are gearing up to open the incentivized testnet to all participants shortly. The first to be invited will be our seasoned validators from the Kate Testnet, acknowledging their valuable contribution and support for Avail. Rest assured, your invitation is on its way, so keep an eye out for further announcements.

### I haven't received my invitation, but I see some challenges have started. Why is that?

Do not worry if you haven't received your invite yet. The testnet is structured to offer a multitude of challenges, many of which will be available for the entire duration of the testnet. We are committed to ensuring a balanced and equitable rollout. Stay tuned, as there will be ample opportunities for everyone to participate.

### Has the incentivized testnet commenced?

Yes, the incentivized testnet has started, officially as of November 7, 2023. Please keep an eye out for updates.

### Will the Kate network be utilized for the incentivized testnet?

No, the Kate network will not be used for the incentivized testnet. A new network will be established specifically for the testnet activities.

### Are there any restrictions on the telemetry dashboard available at telemetry.avail.tools?

Yes, there are limitations to the telemetry dashboard at [<ins>telemetry.avail.tools</ins>](https://telemetry.avail.tools), including a cap at 1,000 entries. We are continuously working to improve the dashboard functionality.

### What do I do if I'm on the Kate testnet?

If you are currently on the Kate testnet, please stay tuned for detailed migration steps or instructions on how to reboot with new binaries for the upcoming incentivized testnet.

### What are the migration steps, or do we have to reboot with new binaries?

Specific migration steps will be provided closer to the launch of the incentivized testnet. It may involve rebooting with new binaries, but we will ensure detailed guidance is available.

### What are the participation criteria and where can I find them?

The participation criteria for the incentivized testnet and Clash of Nodes campaign will be outlined in our official documentation and announcements. Please check our website and community channels for the latest information.

### How long is the Clash of Nodes campaign?

The duration of the Clash of Nodes campaign will be announced along with the launch details. Keep an eye on our official channels for updates.

### Why not just upgrade Kate instead of launching a new incentivized testnet?

The new incentivized testnet is being launched as it offers a fixed and improved testing ground with an incentive mechanism being tested out. This approach allows us to implement and evaluate changes more effectively than upgrading the existing Kate testnet.

### Are there audits taking place, and when can results be shared?

Audits are an essential part of our development process to ensure security and reliability. We will share the results of these audits with the community as soon as they are available and have been thoroughly reviewed.
