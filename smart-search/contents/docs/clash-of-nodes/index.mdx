# Welcome to Clash of Nodes

## Objective

Avail is rapidly advancing modular blockchains and we're calling on node operators to join the Clash of Nodes campaign. This campaign acts as an important proving ground for the Avail network, providing participants with an incentivized, real-time testnet environment. It's designed to rigorously test Avail's capabilities as the base layer poised to support a new generation of rollup-centric blockchain infrastructure.

## Who is Clash of Nodes For?

A campaign for everyone.

### Light Clients

Join the Clash of Nodes by running a light client and take part in Avail's mission to build a scalable blockchain infrastructure. Avail's light client functionality is uniquely designed to empower anyone, anywhere to participate in the network.

### Validators

The Clash of Nodes incentivized testnet is an opportunity for validators to engage with Avail's infrastructure in a simulated production environment. Participants will contribute to the network's resilience through a series of challenges, with the potential to earn rewards based on their performance and engagement.

## Key Campaign Concepts

The following table serves as a quick reference to understand the various elements that make up the Clash of Nodes campaign.

If there are any unclear concepts about Avail, head over to the [<ins>glossary</ins>](/docs/learn-about-avail/glossary.mdx) for definitions and explanations.

| Concept                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Challenges**           | Tasks or objectives that participants complete to test and strengthen the network. Challenges are designed to assess performance, security, and reliability as they relate to the data availability guarantees of Avail. |
| **Points**               | A scoring system that rewards participants for completing challenges. Points are tallied on a leaderboard, with potential rewards for top performers.                                                                    |
| **Nominator Pools**      | Groups where participants collectively stake tokens to support a validator. This allows users to participate in network validation and earn rewards without running a full node.                                         |
| **Rollapps**             | Decentralized applications that use Avail's data availability layer. They are key to testing the network's capacity for handling application data.                                                                       |
| **DHT**                  | Distributed Hash Table, a system used by light clients for efficient data storage and retrieval, crucial for maintaining data availability and integrity.                                                                |
| **Vector Functionality** | The network's capability to interact with other blockchains, enabling functionalities like cross-chain data verification and interoperability.                                                                           |
