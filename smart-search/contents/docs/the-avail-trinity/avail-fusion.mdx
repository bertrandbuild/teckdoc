# Avail Fusion

Avail Fusion completes the Avail trinity providing additive security to the Avail ecosystem and the unification layer of web3.
Fusion will enable native assets from other major ecosystems like Bitcoin and Ethereum to be staked alongside Avail's native assets.
This will allow Avail to leverage existing mature assets to bolster its own cryptoeconomic security and marks one of the first 
instances where foreign tokens like ETH and BTC are utilized to power consensus on a different blockchain.

The first public prototype for Avail Fusion is still under development, in the meantime [you can learn more about Fusion here](https://blog.availproject.org/the-avail-vision-accelerating-the-unification-of-web3). <br/>
