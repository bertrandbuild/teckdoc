## Introduction

_**B**lind **A**ssignment for **B**lockchain **E**xtension_ (BABE) serves as a block production engine, drawing inspiration from [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf), another proof-of-stake protocol. It functions
autonomously, offering probabilistic finality, or it can be integrated with a finality mechanism like GRANDPA.

BABE operates on a slot-based algorithm, dividing time into eras, epochs, further segmented into slots. Within the Avail context, each slot lasts for twenty seconds, aligning with the
target block time. In every slot, BABE determines an author (or potentially multiple authors) responsible for producing a block.

On Avail's explorer, you can observe the eras and epochs by navigating to the staking page and locating the information at the top-right corner.

## BABE Block Production Process

Each slot may have both a primary and a secondary author, chosen from amongst a set of active validators. The assignment of
primary authors, aka slot leaders, is a random process governed by the VRF function. However, due to the way the function works, there may be instances where no validators qualify as the primary author. To maintain a consistent block time,
BABE employs a round-robin system to designate secondary slot leaders, who produce new blocks without a designated leader.

As we know, the selection of primary authors is powered by a verifiable random function (VRF). It thus becomes
crucial to establish a universally accepted form of randomness that remains untampered and verifiable for all parties involved. VRFs address this challenge by generating a
pseudo-random number accompanied by a proof of its proper generation. These functions take various parameters, including a private key. The VRF considers an epoch random
seed (pre-determined by all nodes), a slot number, and the author's private key. As each node possesses a unique private key, this ensures the generation of a distinct pseudo-random
value for each slot.

During an epoch, each author employs its VRF for every slot. For slots where the output falls below an agreed-upon threshold, the validator gains the right to author a block during
that slot. The random nature of slot assignment introduces the possibility of slots without a primary leader and those with multiple primaries.

To address vacant slots and maintain uninterrupted block production, BABE incorporates a round-robin fallback mechanism. Each slot is assigned a secondary leader. In cases where
no entity declares itself as the primary leader at the slot's commencement, the secondary leader steps in to produce a block. This fallback mechanism ensures that every slot has
an assigned block author, contributing to the assurance of a consistent block time.

Below is an example of BABE block production in action.

## BABE Functions

Here's an overview of how BABE functions.

**Slot-Based Consensus**: BABE operates on a slot-based mechanism, where time is divided into fixed intervals known as slots. Each slot represents a designated timeframe during which
a new block can be produced.

**Leader Election**: In each slot, a leader is elected to propose and produce a new block for the parachain. The leader election process in BABE is deterministic and depends on a
combination of the block's hash and a random number derived from the VRF (Verifiable Random Function) scheme. The VRF helps ensure unpredictability while still allowing nodes to verify the legitimacy of the leader.

**Blind Assignment**: The term "Blind Assignment" in BABE refers to the process of selecting the leader for a slot without revealing the identity of the leader until the block is
produced. This adds an element of security and prevents potential attacks based on knowing in advance who the leader will be.

**Adaptive Time Slot Duration**: BABE features an adaptive time slot duration, meaning that the length of each slot can be adjusted dynamically based on network conditions. This
adaptability helps Avail handle variations in block production times more efficiently.

**Finalization**: While BABE is responsible for proposing and producing blocks, finalization of blocks is achieved through the GRANDPA consensus algorithm. GRANDPA is responsible
for ensuring the overall security and consistency of the Avail chain.

While BABE is a powerful algorithm to select new block authors in a verifiably random way, Avail uses GRANDPA in addition to BABE to achieve deterministic chain finalization. In the next article, we will learn about GRANDPA, Avail's block finalization mechanism.

# GRANDPA

## Introduction

GRANDPA, which stands for "_**G**host-based **R**ecursive **AN**cestor **D**eriving **P**refix **A**greement_," is the consensus algorithms used by Avail. GRANDPA works in conjunction with another consensus
GRANDPA in and of itself is a block finalization algorithm, and as such needs to be paired with block-authoring mechanisms like [Aura](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/sc_consensus_aura/index.html) or BABE (Avail uses BABE) to ensure a properly functioning blockchain.

Finality in GRANDPA's context means that once a block is added to the blockchain, it is irreversible and cannot be reverted. This is in
contrast to probabilistic finality found in some other consensus mechanisms.

To observe a straightforward illustration of GRANDPA in action, inspecting Avail node log files reveals both the importation of blocks and the subsequent finalization of these blocks.
In the below logs extract, the first block to undergo finalization is 127972, followed by 127973 and 127974. As emphasized earlier, this signifies that the information contained in
blocks from 127974 and those preceding it has achieved finality, rendering them immutable and irreversible.

```

## GRANDPA Functions

Here's an overview of how GRANDPA functions within Avail, up and above finality.

**GHOST Protocol**: GRANDPA utilizes the GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree) protocol, a concept borrowed from Ethereum's blockchain protocol. The GHOST protocol helps in
selecting the most secure and agreed-upon chain by considering not only the main chain but also the "uncles" or competing blocks.

**Recursive Ancestor Derivation**: GRANDPA employs a recursive ancestor derivation mechanism to efficiently determine the finality of blocks. This process involves determining a
common ancestor among a set of competing blocks in the network. This common ancestor is then used to finalize the blocks.

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: GRANDPA is Byzantine Fault Tolerant, meaning it can maintain its correctness and security even when some nodes in the network behave maliciously or
fail. This is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the consensus algorithm in the face of potential attacks.

**Finality Gadget**: GRANDPA is often referred to as a "finality gadget" because it specifically focuses on providing finality to the blocks produced by the BABE consensus algorithm
on the Avail chain. While BABE is responsible for proposing and producing blocks, GRANDPA finalizes these blocks, ensuring that they are permanently added to the blockchain.

## GRANDPA Finalisation Steps

GRANDPA sequence of events to bring about the finalization of new blocks:

- A node assigned as the "primary" disseminates the highest block it deems potentially final from the preceding round.
- Following a network delay, each validator broadcasts a "pre-vote" for the highest block it believes should be finalized. Assuming the supermajority of validators are honest,
  this block should extend the chain initially broadcast by the primary. This newly proposed chain might consist of several blocks more than the last chain that was officially finalized.
- Each validator calculates the highest block that can be deemed finalized based on the collection of pre-votes. If the set of pre-votes extends the last officially finalized chain,
  each validator proceeds to cast a "pre-commit" in favor of that particular chain.
- Subsequently, each validator awaits the reception of adequate pre-commits to formulate a commit message, officially endorsing the newly finalized chain.

# NPoS

## Introduction

Before delving into Avail's consensus, it's crucial to grasp the concept of consensus and its role. Consensus serves as a method to reach agreement on a shared state. For the
continuous progression of the blockchain's state, all nodes within the network must collectively agree and achieve consensus. This consensus mechanism is essential for decentralized
networks, ensuring synchronization among nodes. In the absence of consensus in a decentralized blockchain network, there is no guarantee that the state acknowledged by one node
aligns with the perspectives of other nodes. Consensus strives to establish an objective representation of the state within a network where participants hold subjective views.
It is the mechanism through which nodes communicate, reach agreement, and collaboratively generate new blocks.

In order to cover Avails concensus we must cover

- **Nominated Proof of Stake (NPOS)** which focuses on who is allowed to take part in concensus
- **GRANDPA** which focuses on what is the last and final change/block
- **BABE** which focuses on who will propose the next change/block

Lets dig deeper into Nominated Proof of Stake (NPOS) first.

### Nominated Proof of Stake (NPOS)

Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) represents a variation of Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), which functions as a consensus algorithm within blockchain networks to establish
distributed consensus. DPoS entails a set of guidelines for selecting the validator set on blockchains. Instead of all token holders having eligibility to create and validate blocks,
a specific number of validators, referred to as "delegates" or "witnesses," are chosen to produce blocks and validate transactions. Typically, token holders cast votes to elect these
validators through a delegation process. In a DPoS system, token holders possess the authority to vote for their preferred delegates, who subsequently take turns producing blocks and
validating transactions.

The purpose of NPoS aligns with DPoS, aiming to select trustworthy validators for consensus execution. However, the selection mechanism differs. In NPoS, rather than a delegator
choosing a single validator or specifying which validator their token supports, they nominate a predetermined quantity of validators they are comfortable seeing elected.
This nomination process gives rise to the term "Nominate Proof of Stake," where the individual staking tokens is referred to as a nominator.

In simple terms, within the Avail ecosystem, you can act as a nominator (or delegator/staker) and nominate up to 16 validators. You do not need to select all 16, you may select any qty under 16.

As a participant with a stake in the network, your contribution may be directed towards endorsing a single validator during a particular era. The illustration below highlights the
potential scenario where your stake is utilized to back and support a specific validator within the given timeframe

<img src="/img/avail/nominator-elected-1.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

Alternatively, your stake may be diversified among multiple validators from the pool of 16 nominees. For instance, in the presented scenario, your stake has been distributed across
three different validators. This diversification allows you to participate in supporting and securing multiple validators, contributing to the overall resilience and decentralization
of the network.

<img src="/img/avail/nominator-elected-3.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

The goal is to utilize your tokens effectively, backing validators that enable the highest staking of AVL (Avail's native token) and bring the maximum number of validators online.

### Nominated Proof of Stake (NPOS) validator work allocation

In certain Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols, such as Tendermint, the likelihood of a validator being chosen for block production or network work allocation increases with the amount of
stake they hold. Essentially, the higher the stake a validator possesses, the more opportunities they have to participate in key network activities. However, in Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS),
a different approach is taken, where all elected validators are treated on an equal footing. Regardless of their stake size or the quantity of nominators supporting them, NPoS
ensures that every validator receives similar workloads without any preferential treatment based on stake size or the number of supporters.

It's crucial to note that, in the NPoS model, the equality in workload distribution doesn't imply an identical chance of being elected for all validators. Validators with larger
stakes and a higher number of nominators still hold a greater probability of being elected. The democratic nature of NPoS lies in the fact that once elected, all validators,
irrespective of their individual stake size, share an equitable workload, fostering a fair and balanced participation framework within the network.

Therefore, while the selection process may favor validators with more substantial stakes and broader support among nominators, the subsequent allocation of work is conducted
impartially, ensuring that elected validators contribute to the network in a manner that aligns with the principles of fairness and inclusivity.
