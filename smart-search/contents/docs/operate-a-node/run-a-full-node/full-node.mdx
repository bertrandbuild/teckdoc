# How to Run a full node

## Running a Full Node with Binaries

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run a full node for the Avail network using pre-compiled binaries. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced node operator, this guide aims to make the process straightforward.

<Callout type="info">
BEFORE YOU START<br/>
**Ensure that you meet the [<ins>system requirements</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-full-node/requirements).**
We recommend downloading the pre-compiled binary for speed and convenience.

### Option 1: Run the Pre-Built Release

All you need to do is run:

```bash
./data-avail -d ./data --chain goldberg --name MyAvailNode
```

Your node will also appear on the [<ins>Avail Telemetry</ins>](http://telemetry.avail.tools/) site, listed under the "Node name" from the node command output. Be sure to select the appropriate network tab at the top to view your node's status.

### Option 2: Build From Source

To compile the client source code, run the node:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/data-avail -d ./data --chain goldberg --name MyAvailNode
```

## How to Run a Full Node with Docker

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running a full node on the Avail network using Docker. Whether you're new to node operation or have prior experience, this guide is designed to make the setup process straightforward.

**Ensure that you meet the [<ins>system requirements</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-full-node/requirements).** We recommend downloading the pre-compiled binary for speed and convenience.
</Callout>

### Step 1: Launch Your Avail Node

To launch your Avail node, navigate to the `/mnt/avail` directory and execute the following Docker command:

```bash
cd /mnt/avail
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/state:/da/state:rw -p 30333:30333 -p 9615:9615 -p 9944:9944 -d --restart unless-stopped availj/avail:v1.10.0.0 --chain goldberg --name "MyAweasomeInContainerAvailAnode" -d /da/state
```

> The Docker command performs several important steps:

> - Map the state directory, providing read-write permissions for data persistence.
> - Opens various ports for different functionalities, including P2P connections, metrics, and HTTP RPC.
> - Utilizes the Avail image from Docker Hub and sets it to restart unless manually stopped.

### Step 2: Verify Node Functionality

#### Inspect Node Logs

To confirm that your node is operating as expected, inspect the Docker logs by running the following:

```bash
ubuntu:/mnt/avail# docker ps
ubuntu:/mnt/avail# docker logs 5b3978de8f35  # 5b3978de8f35 is the container id
```

#### Monitor Your Node

You can monitor the status of your node on the [<ins>Avail Telemetry</ins>](http://telemetry.avail.tools/) website.
