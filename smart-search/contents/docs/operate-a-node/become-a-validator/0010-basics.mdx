# Avail Node - Basics

## Introduction

The goal of this guide is to help you learn the basics of running Avail Node. Don't worry; it's not too complicated, and it won't take you longer than 5 minutes to get a good grasp of how everything works.

<Callout type="info"> 
BEFORE YOU START<br/>
All the guides, including this one, assume that you are using a Linux or macOS-based system. If you are running Windows and want to follow this guide, make sure to install WSL and continue the guide inside an Ubuntu or Debian instance. To learn more about WSL, check the following [LINK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

NOTE<br/>
Before trying anything, make sure that you fully read the chapter first before doing any actual work.

## Installation & Setup

Our first step is to obtain the prebuilt binary for Avail Node. We offer a wide range of prebuilds, but in case you don't see your Linux flavor or architecture here, head to the FAQ chapter to learn how to build your own executable.

Prebuild list:

- Ubuntu: [20.04](#ubuntu-2004) [22.04](#ubuntu-2204) [23.10](#ubuntu-2310)
- Debian: [11](#debian-11) [12](#debian-12)
- Fedora: [38](#fedora-38) [39](#fedora-39)
- Arch: [Latest](#arch)

Once you have found your OS (or picked the generic one), execute the given command to obtain the needed Avail Node binary.

## Running Our First Network

With the binary ready in our working directory, it's time to run it and see what we get.

```bash
./data-avail
```

Output:

```
Error: Input("Please specify which chain you want to run, e.g. --chain goldberg")
```

Yikes, an error. This is okay; by default, our node doesn't know which chain (network) it should connect to. To fix this, we will provide one, but not the recommended one, not yet.

Instead, we are going to run a development network:

```bash
./data-avail --chain dev
```

Output:

```

Okay, things are looking better now. No errors so far, but let's break it down for clarity.

### Understanding the logs

```bash
2023-11-27 16:26:31 Avail Node
2023-11-27 16:26:31 ✌️  version 1.8.3-6d8aff28012
2023-11-27 16:26:31 ❤️  by Anonymous, 2017-2023
2023-11-27 16:26:31 📋 Chain specification: Avail Development Network
2023-11-27 16:26:31 🏷  Node name: cagey-owl-5997
2023-11-27 16:26:31 👤 Role: FULL
```

The first, second, and fourth lines indicate that we're running Avail Node v1.8.3 with the Development chain—exactly what we wanted.

The fifth line, `🏷  Node name: cagey-owl-5997`, shows our node name as `cagey-owl-5997`, which isn't ideal. We'll change that shortly.

The last line, `👤 Role: FULL`, reveals that our node is in Full mode, meaning it can't produce blocks. We'll address that too.

### Changing Name

To change our node's name, use the `--name` flag. Before proceeding, make sure to stop your node with Ctrl-C. Now, let's rerun it with a more appealing name:

```bash
./data-avail --chain dev --name KingMagnifico
```

Output:

```bash
2023-11-27 16:39:37 Avail Node
2023-11-27 16:39:37 ✌️  version 1.8.3-6d8aff28012

2023-11-27 16:39:37 👤 Role: FULL
...
```

### Changing from Full to Validator mode

To run our node in validator mode, add the `--validator` flag along with the others. Without this mode, the node won't produce new blocks.

Stop your node again with Ctrl+C and rerun it with the `--validator` flag::

```bash
./data-avail --chain dev --name KingMagnifico --validator
```

Output:

```bash
2023-11-27 16:41:49 Avail Node
2023-11-27 16:41:49 ✌️  version 1.8.3-6d8aff28012
2023-11-27 16:41:49 ❤️  by Anonymous, 2017-2023
2023-11-27 16:41:49 📋 Chain specification: Avail Development Network
2023-11-27 16:41:49 🏷  Node name: KingMagnifico
2023-11-27 16:41:49 👤 Role: AUTHORITY
...
```

Now, instead of 'FULL,' it should say 'AUTHORITY,' indicating that our node is almost ready to produce blocks.

### Session Keys and Peers

If we let our program run for a minute or two, we'll notice the same message being repeated:

```bash
...
2023-11-27 16:48:57 💤 Idle (0 peers), best: #0 (0xdb94…2e21), finalized #0 (0xdb94…2e21), ⬇ 0 ⬆ 0
```

Our node is operating in validator mode, but the network expects validator 'Alice' to be online. To enable block production, besides using the `--validator` flag, the node needs session keys for signing various parts of block production. Without these keys, the network can't identify the block producer, leaving us stuck at block 0. In the next chapter, we'll address how to generate your own session keys. For this development network, we can use the `--alice` flag, and it will automatically insert Alice's session keys.

Let's stop our node again with Ctrl+C and rerun it with the `--alice` flag:

```bash
./data-avail --chain dev --name KingMagnifico --validator --alice
```

Output:

```bash

```

Now, we are running our own development network and we are producing and finalizing blocks. If this doesn't work and you're still stuck at block zero, try adding `--force-authoring` along with the other flags.

### There Must Be A Simpler Way

Although we've used several flags to run a development network, there's an easier way—use the `--dev` flag. This flag combines the following flags into one: `--chain=dev`, `--force-authoring`, `--alice`, `--tmp`, and `--rpc-cors=all`. The last two flags, `--tmp` and `--rpc-cors=all`, are new to us, and we'll discuss `--tmp` shortly.

Stop the node again with Ctrl+C and rerun it with the `--dev` flag:

```bash
./data-avail --dev --name KingMagnifico
```

Output:

```bash

```

And we get the same result.

### Temporary and Persistante Storage

When our node runs a network, it needs to store network-related data. By not specifying a location, it stores the data in a default location, which is often not what we want.

Using the `--tmp` flag makes it use a different location each time we run our network. This is implied when using `--dev` and is useful when we don't care about preserving our state. To make our storage persistent through runs, we can use the `-d` flag.

```bash
./data-avail --dev --name KingMagnifico -d ./node-data
```

Output

```bash

2023-11-27 17:13:54 💾 Database: RocksDb at ./node-data/chains/avail_development_network/db/full
```

In the logs (output), you'll notice our database is now located at `./node-data/chains/avail_development_network/db/full` instead of the `tmp` folder.

Once the node is running, a new folder named `node-data` will be created in the working directory. If you take a look, you will see that it consists of subdirectories like `chains` and `avail_development_network`. Inside the last directory, you should find our network data.

After running the node for a minute or two, stop it by pressing Ctrl+C and rerun it. It should use the same storage (database) location and continue from the last produced block.

Now stop the node with Ctrl+C and let's remove our storage: `rm ./node-data -r`.

## Connecting Our Node to Goldberg

With all this preliminary knowledge ready to be used, we can now finally take the last step and connect our node to the Goldberg network. I will use the same name as before, KingMagnifico, but I suggest you choose one that you like.

Before running our node, ensure that our storage folder is removed or empty, and that we don't have any previous nodes already running. With that said, let's finally do what we've been waiting for since the beginning:

```bash
./data-avail --chain goldberg --name KingMagnifico --validator -d ./node-data
```

Output:

Okay, so far so good. Our role is `AUTHORITY`, which means that we are running in validator mode. Our name is clearly the correct one, KingMagnifico, and our database location is correct. Let's see the next few log lines:

Nothing that we haven't seen before, except for the last two lines. `⚙️  Syncing` means that we are syncing all the blocks that were already built, which is exactly what we wanted to see. Let's check the next few lines:

It's syncing around 450 blocks per second—quite fast! If we leave it for 5 or 10 minutes, it should be done syncing, and this is what we are going to see:

```bash

```

Once we see `💤 Idle`, we are done syncing, and our node has now fully caught up.

## What's Next

This is where our story ends. We have a working node connected to the Goldberg chain. It doesn't do much right now, certainly doesn't produce any blocks, but this is something that we will fix. Before that, let's discuss in the next chapter how to do a simple but effective deployment.
