# Building on the Madara Stack with Avail

The Madara stack, when integrated with Avail in a Validium setup, provides a seamless platform for scaling blockchain applications. This integration combines the customizability and Starknet compatibility of Madara with the robust data availability solutions of Avail.

### Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Transaction Submission**

   - **Process**: Users initiate transactions which are sent to the Madara-based Validium Sequencer.
   - **Role**: The Sequencer, leveraging the flexibility of Madara, temporarily holds these transactions.

2. **Batch Processing**

   - **Component**: Customized within Madara's framework.
   - **Function**: Transactions are batched for efficient processing, leveraging Madara's modular design.

3. **Data Availability with Avail**

   - **Component**: Custom integration within Madara's setup.
   - **Function**: Batches are published to Avail for data availability, ensuring transparency and accessibility.

4. **State Transition and Proof Generation**

   - **Component**: Utilizes Madara's Starknet compatibility.
   - **Function**: State transitions are processed, and cryptographic proofs are generated within the Madara environment.

5. **Commitment and Verification**
   - **Action**: Commitments, along with proofs, are anchored to a primary blockchain (e.g., Ethereum), ensuring security and finality.

### Key Features

- **Customizability**: Madara's Substrate-based framework allows for extensive customization to meet specific blockchain requirements.
- **Starknet Compatibility**: Madara's compatibility with Starknet opens a wide array of tools and features for developers.
- **Robust Data Availability**: Avail provides a decentralized solution for data availability, crucial for scalability and security in blockchain applications.
- **Flexibility and Interoperability**: The combination of Madara and Avail supports a wide range of blockchain architectures and use cases.
