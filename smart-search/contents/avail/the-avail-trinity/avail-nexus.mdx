# Avail Nexus

## Introduction to Avail Nexus

**Avail Nexus is a permissionless framework to unify the web3 ecosystem. 
It connects multiple blockchains both within and outside the Avail ecosystem, leveraging Avail DA as the root of trust.**

Avail Nexus is a more structured component of Avail, outlining specific integration standards between rollups.
This layer is pivotal in crafting a seamless user experience across multiple scenarios, whether users are engaging with a single rollup, 
navigating multiple rollups within Avail, or interacting with chains in external ecosystems.

Avail Nexus is a zero-knowledge proof based coordination rollup on Avail DA that consists of a proof aggregation/verification layer and a 
sequencer selection mechanism that is made possible via embedding validity proof based Avail DAS (Data Availability Sampling) light clients and 
execution proof aggregation. The aggregated proof will also be sent to Ethereum.
