### How to Deploy a Madara Appchain

1. **Create a New Appchain Instance**: To begin, create a new appchain instance. Detailed instructions can be found **[<ins>here</ins>](https://github.com/karnotxyz/madara-cli)**. This step involves setting up the environment and initializing your appchain using the Karnot CLI. **Ensure you select 'Avail' as the DA layer**.

> For help in creating an AppId, check out the **[<ins>AppId guide</ins>](/docs/end-user-guide/app-id)**.

1. **Fund Your Avail Account**: You will also need to fund your Avail account for your appchain. Visit the Avail faucet with your Avail address and follow the **[<ins>faucet guide instructions</ins>](/docs/end-user-guide/faucet)** to secure the necessary testnet tokens for the Goldberg network.

   > The faucet requires meeting a mandatory threshold using the Gitcoin passport. If necessary, you can link your Avail account on your machine with the wallet you are using for this process. Exercise caution when exporting your account's key for any reason.

1. **If Needed, Host Your Appchain with Karnot**: Karnot provides comprehensive, ready-to-use services for appchains, including RPC, proof, cross-chain capabilities, and more. Fill out **[<ins>this form</ins>](https://forms.gle/8cYP2d3PqMDZc5oj7)** to request hosting services.

1. **Create a PR to Register Your Appchain**: For your appchain to be recognized in the Clash of Nodes campaign, you must register it by submitting a pull request in the **[<ins>avail-campaign-listing</ins>](https://github.com/karnotxyz/avail-campaign-listing)** repository. The PR should include a JSON configuration file named "listing.json" with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my_app_chain",
     "logo": "https://placehold.co/400x400",
     "rpc_url": "https://rpc.myappchain.xyz",
     "explorer_url": "https://explorer.myappchain.xyz",
     "metrics_endpoint": "https://metrics.myappchain.xyz",
     "id": "942ff35e-f048-4d10-ae61-6cb970cad2f0"
   }
   ```

   <p align="center"><img src="/img/karnot/karnot-pr.png" alt="Karnot PR Submission" width="100%"/></p>

   This configuration file includes essential details about your appchain, such as its name, logo URL, RPC endpoint, explorer URL, metrics endpoint, and a unique identifier. Ensure all information is accurate and up-to-date to facilitate smooth registration and participation in the campaign. Once the PR is merged, the appchain will appear on the **[<ins>Clash of Nodes Leaderboard</ins>](https://leaderboard.availproject.org/)**.
