# Building on the Polygon zkEVM with Avail

Polygon zkEVM, when combined with Avail in a Validium setup, provides a robust solution for scaling Ethereum applications. Here's an overview of this setup:

### Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Transaction Submission**

   - **Process**: Users initiate transactions by sending them to the Validium Sequencer.
   - **Role**: The Sequencer temporarily holds these transactions before they are processed.

2. **Batch Processing**

   - **Component**: `validium-batcher`
   - **Function**: Transactions are grouped into batches to optimize processing efficiency.

3. **Data Availability with Avail**

   - **Component**: `avail-validator`
   - **Function**: Transaction batches are transmitted to Avail's blockchain, where they are validated and made available for further processing within the Validium environment.

4. **Proof Generation**

   - **Component**: `zkevm-prover`
   - **Function**: A dedicated prover generates cryptographic proofs for the Validium network, ensuring the validity of transactions and data availability on Ethereum.

5. **Transaction Commitment to Ethereum**

   - **Component**: `validium-bridge`
   - **Action**: Validity proofs and transaction commitments are submitted to the Ethereum network, anchoring the Validium state on the Ethereum mainnet.

6. **Verifier and Rollup Node Integration**
   - **Component**: `validium-node`
   - **Function**: The Validium node queries Ethereum for transaction data and commitments, maintaining data availability and enabling users to interact with the Validium chain securely.

### Interoperability and Fault Tolerance

The combination of Polygon zkEVM and Avail in the Validium setup is designed to seamlessly integrate with Polygon's fault-tolerant system. This ensures the robustness of the Validium Sequencer while enabling efficient cross-chain communication and interoperability.

### Developer Onboarding

Developers interested in leveraging Polygon zkEVM with Avail within the Validium framework can begin by referring to the comprehensive guide provided in the [Avail Validium GitHub repository](https://github.com/availproject/validium-contracts). For ongoing support and updates, developers are encouraged to join the Avail community forum or Discord channel.
