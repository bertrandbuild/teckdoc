# Network Information

<Callout type="info">
As of now, Goldberg is the only supported testnet on Avail. Kate is officially deprecated.
We will keep this page updated with the latest information on new networks.

## Pioneering Blockchain Modularity

**The Goldberg Testnet is the latest test network of the Avail Project.**

### Phase One: Laying the Groundwork

The inaugural phase of Avail's testnet served as a sandbox for fundamental
operations, including the execution of on-chain functions and the initiation
of protocol governance. This phase was instrumental in setting the stage for
more advanced testing scenarios.

### Phase Two: Expanding the Testing Ecosystem

The second phase aims to provide a robust testing environment designed to foster
increased participation from validators. Validators are crucial network participants
who leverage their computing resources to validate transactions and fortify network
security, often in exchange for token-based rewards.

#### User Participation on the Testnet

The Kate testnet offers a multitude of avenues for user engagement:

- **Token Acquisition**: Users can obtain AVL testnet tokens to explore staking and
  nomination functionalities.
- **Blockchain Development**: Users have the freedom to develop modular blockchain applications
  or chains that integrate with Avail's data layer.
- **Network Roles**: Users can opt to join the testnet as either validators or light clients,
  facilitating data verification processes.

### Phase Three: Incentivized Testnet

Avail is now ushering in the [<ins>Clash of Nodes</ins>](/category/clash-of-nodes/) campaign using the Goldberg testnet. This campaign is a call to action for node operators to participate in an incentivized, real-time testnet environment. It's a critical testbed for Avail's infrastructure, designed to rigorously evaluate its capacity as a foundational layer for the next wave of rollup-centric blockchain ecosystems.
