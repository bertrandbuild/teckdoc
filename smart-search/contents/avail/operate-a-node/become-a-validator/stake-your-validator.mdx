# How to Stake Your Validator

This guide offers a step-by-step walkthrough on how to stake your Avail validator.
It covers essential steps such as bonding your funds, managing session keys, and initiating the validation process.

<Callout type="info"> 
BEFORE YOU START<br/>
This chapter continues from the 'Session Keys' page, so be sure to read that one before proceeding with this one.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Prepare for Staking

Before you can become an active validator, you need to bond your funds to your node. This involves creating two separate Avail accounts: a `stash` account for holding your funds and a `controller` account for managing staking actions.

### Create Avail Accounts

1.  Navigate to the Goldberg network explorer at [<ins>goldberg.avail.tools</ins>](https://goldberg.avail.tools/).
2.  Create a `stash` and a `controller` account. The `stash` account should ideally be a cold wallet, while the `controller` can be a hot wallet.
    > - The controller key is responsible for managing staking activities and executing transactions,
        including the payment of transaction fees.
    > - The stash key primarily safeguards your funds and should ideally be stored in a cold wallet or
        kept offline. It is not recommended to use the stash key for routine account activities like submitting
        extrinsics.
3.  Ensure both accounts have sufficient funds to cover transaction fees.

<Callout>
FUNDING ACCOUNTS<br/>
Keep the majority of your funds in the `stash` account and only a minimal amount in the `controller`
account to cover transaction fees.
</Callout>

For validators participating in our testnet, contact the Avail team to have funds
transferred.

### Bond Your Funds

<Callout>
BONDING TIPS<br/>
Don't bond all your AVL tokens as you'll need some for transaction fees. You can always bond more tokens later.
Note: Withdrawing any bonded amount is subject to the duration of the unbonding period.
</Callout>

1. Navigate to the **Staking** tab in the Explorer.
2. Click on `Stash` to initiate the bonding process.
   <img src="/img/avail/staking-bond-1.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

3. Fill in the bonding preferences.

> - **Stash Account:** This is your designated Stash account.
> - **Controller Account:** Choose your Controller account, which only requires a minimal amount of AVL to initiate and cease validation.
> - **Value Bonded:** Specify the quantity of AVL tokens you wish to bond from your Stash account. You can stake any amount that exceeds the minimum requirement.
> - **Payment Destination:** This is the account where your validation rewards will be sent. For more details, visit [this link](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#reward-distribution).

4. After filling in the required fields, click `Bond`. You will be prompted to enter your wallet password. Input your password and then click **Sign and Submit**.

You should now be ready to generate your session keys. Note the
**Session Key** button, in the next step we will generate a key to
submit here. <img src="/img/avail/staking-bond-4.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

## Step 2: Manage Session Keys

After your node is fully synced, you'll need to rotate and submit your session keys.

### Rotating Session Keys

Run the following command on your node machine:

> Ensure the node is running with the default HTTP RPC port configured.

#### Using Binaries:

```shell
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9944
```

The result is the concatenation of the four public keys. Save the hex-encoded
result for the next step and **restart your node**.

#### Using Docker:

```shell
docker ps
```

You should an output similar to:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                   COMMAND            CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                            NAMES
da097bbeba75   availj/avail:v1.8.0.4   "/entrypoint.sh"   3 seconds ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:9615->9615/tcp, :::9615->9615/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9944->9944/tcp, 0.0.0.0:30333->30333/tcp, :::9944->9944/tcp   musing_cartwright
```

We need the `CONTAINER ID` from the output above:

```shell
docker exec -i da097bbeba75 curl -sH "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9944
```

### Submit Session Keys

You must inform the network of your Session keys by signing and submitting the
`setKeys` extrinsic. This action associates your validator with your Controller account.

1. Navigate back to the **[<ins>Staking</ins>](https://goldberg.avail.tools/#/staking/actions)** tab.
2. Click on `Set Session Key` and enter the hex-encoded result.
3. Click `Set Session Key` and enter your password when prompted.

<img src="/img/avail/set-session-keys.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

After submitting the extrinsic, you'll observe that **Set Session Key** changes
to **Validate**. Make sure your node is fully synchronized before proceeding further.

## Step 3: Register as a Validator

1. Click `Validate` on the **Staking** tab.

<img src="/img/avail/start-validating.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

2. Set your validator commission percentage.
3. Enter your password and click `Validate`.

<img src="/img/avail/set-validate-commission.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

## Step 4: Start Validation

Your validator is now prepared to begin the validation process. If you wish to discontinue,
you can click the stop icon. Please note that the Avail interface doesn't automatically verify
if your node is synchronized; you'll need to confirm this manually. If your node has sufficient
stake, the Avail blockchain will likely select it in the next epoch or two.

### Verify Validator Status

To verify that your node is ready for possible selection at the end of
the next era, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **[<ins>Staking</ins>](https://goldberg.avail.tools/#/staking)** tab and
   select `Waiting` to see if your account appears.
2. If your node has enough stake, it will be elected in the next era or two.
   > A new set of validators is chosen every **era**, based on the amount staked.

<img src="/img/avail/validator-waiting-list.png" width="100%" height="100%"/>

### Monitor Validator in Action

Once your validator node has accrued enough stake, it will be elected for validation.
Below is an example image of an elected validator node actively producing blocks.

In addition, please check out the guide on validator monitoring available
[<ins>here</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/become-a-validator/monitor-your-validator).

## Next Steps

Congratulations on successfully setting up your Avail Validator node!

As you move forward, here are some essential actions to consider:

1. **Backup Your Validator**: Ensure you have a secure backup of your validator settings and keys. Refer to the
   [<ins>Backup Guide</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/become-a-validator/backup-your-validator) for detailed steps.

2. **Start Monitoring**: If you haven't already, set up monitoring tools to keep track of your validator's performance. Check out the [<ins>Monitoring Guide</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/become-a-validator/monitor-your-validator) for recommendations.

3. **Join the Community**: Connect with other validators and the Avail team on the official [<ins>Discord Channel</ins>](https://discord.com/invite/y6fHnxZQX8). It's a great place to share experiences, ask questions, and get updates.
